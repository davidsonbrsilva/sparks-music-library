**Sparks Music Library** is a library of classes built in .Net 5 for recognition, extraction and transposition of musical chords.

It is very common to find transposition solutions that reduce the note mapping to the twelve possible sounds to be reproduced in the western scale, making it contain sharps or flats, but not both. This can limit the user's desire to see enharmony equivalent to that generated by transposition. For example, the desired result may be the harmonic field of `Bb`, but what you get is the harmonic field of `A#`.

Both `Bb` and `A#` are called enharmonic chords (they produce the same sound but have different names) and can play different roles depending on the context. For this reason, the simplified result of these transposition solutions can result in an unwanted result. That's where Sparks Music Library finds space, trying to respect the role played by the chord when considering results in flat, sharp, double flat and double sharp.

## Requirements

- [.Net 5.0 SDK](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/)* (optional, but recommended)

> \* .Net 5.0 SDK já incluso. Você não precisa instalá-lo se optar pelo Visual Studio.

## Installing

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/davidsonbrsilva/sparks-music-library.git
```

Access the project root folder:

```
cd sparks-music-library
```

Build the library:

```
dotnet build
```

The library files will be generated and it will be ready for usage.

## Tests

For tests, run the command:

```
dotnet test
```

## Usage quick guide

For start, import the library `SparksMusic.Library` to your project:

```
using SparksMusic.Library;
```

Most SparksMusic Library methods throw exceptions on operations and must be caught by `try-catch` statements. For the sake of simplicity, consider that all of the following calls are wrapped in `try-catch` statements:

```csharp
try
{
    // SparksMusic Library operations here
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

### Transposition

Use method `TransposeUp` if you want to transpose chords up and `TransposeDown` if you want to transpose chords down. Both receive as parameters the character string of the chord to be transposed and the amount of semitones for the transposition.

Transpose up

```csharp
Chord transposed = Transposer.TransposeUp("A", 2);
Console.WriteLine(transposed); // B
```

Transpose down

```csharp
Chord transposed = Transposer.TransposeDown("A", 2);
Console.WriteLine(transposed); // G
```

Other method overloads take note, chord, and chord list as parameters.

### Getting chromatic matching

Use the `GetChromaticCorrespondent` method to get the chromatic equivalent of the given note. For example, `A#` is returned as `Bb` and vice versa.

```csharp
Note note = new Note(NoteLetter.A, Accident.Sharp);
Note correspondent = Transposer.GetChromaticCorrespondent(note);
Console.WriteLine(correspondent); // Bb
```

Notes without accidentals are returned as the input. For example `A` is returned as `A`.

```csharp
Note note = new Note(NoteLetter.A, Accident.None);
Note correspondent = Transposer.GetChromaticCorrespondent(note);
Console.WriteLine(correspondent); // A
```

### Extraction

Use the `ExtractChords` method if you want to extract valid chords from a string.

```csharp
// This method extract the valid chords in the provided input text.
// In this case, only G#°, F#m7 and B/A are valid chords.
List<Chord> extractedChords = Transposer.ExtractChords("My chord sequence is G#°  F#m7  Fº+    F#m7/A###     B/A");

foreach (var chord in extractedChords)
{
    Console.WriteLine(chord);
}

// Output:
// G#°
// F#m7
// B/A
```

### Recognition

Use the `IsChord` method if you want to check if the given string matches a valid chord.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.IsChord("A")); // True
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.IsChord("H")); // False
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.IsChord("A#m7")); // True
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.IsChord("A+°")); // False
```

Use the `GetValidChords` method if you want to get a list of valid chord objects from a list of strings.

```csharp
List<string> chordsList = new List<string>{ "A", "H", "A#m7", "A#º" };
List<Chord> validChords = Transposer.GetValidChords(chordsList);

foreach (Chord chord in validChords)
{
    Console.WriteLine(chord);
}

// Output:
// A
// A#m7
```

Use the `HasDifferentChromaticPole` method if you want to check if two notes have different chromatic pole. For example, two notes `A#` and `Bb` return `false` by the method, as the first belongs to the sharp chromatic pole and the second flat.

```csharp
Note note1 = new Note(NoteLetter.A, Accident.Sharp);
Note note2 = new Note(NoteLetter.B, Accident.Flat);
Note note3 = new Note(NoteLetter.C, Accident.None);
Note note4 = new Note(NoteLetter.C, Accident.Sharp);

Console.WriteLine(Transposer.HasDifferentChromaticPole(note1, note2)); // True
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.HasDifferentChromaticPole(note1, note3)); // False
Console.WriteLine(Transposer.HasDifferentChromaticPole(note1, note4)); // False
```

### Optimization

Use the `Optimize` method if you want to apply optimizations to the chord. Currently, the method performs optimization if the note and chord inversion are of different chromatic poles and returns the new optimized chord (for example, `A#/Db` becomes `A#/C#`).

```csharp
Chord optimized = Transposer.Optimize("A#/Db");
Console.WriteLine(optimized); // A#/C#
```
